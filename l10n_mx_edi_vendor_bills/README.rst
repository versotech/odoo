Mexican Localization to Vendor Bills
====================================

This module allow:

- Attach fiscal documents on supplier invoices.
- Create new supplier invoice based on a CFDI.
- Create new supplier refund based on a CFDI.

To allow this process are made some validations as:

- The amount in the CFDI is the same that the invoice total (when only attach)
- The products are searched in the supplier info as first choise. If the product was bought from the
  supplier whose CFDI is being loaded, that info might be already loaded
  in the system.
- That the CFDI is not cancelled on the SAT system.
- The UUID is not attached in other documents
- The Folio in the CFDI is the same that in the vendor reference in the invoice.
- That the CFDI has the attribute TipoDeComprobante = I or TipoDeComprobante = E.
- For supplier refund, it must create a supplier invoice previously.

Only support CFDI on version 3.3

Extra Features:
----------------

When the invoice is generated by the user, and only set the folio in the reference and the CFDI has
``Serie`` and ``Folio``, to allow attach the CFDI with the wizard and avoid that try to create a new
invoice, could be added a new system parameter with the key ``l10n_mx_force_only_folio`` and only
will to search by ``Folio``.

When the receiver name is not found in the CFDI that is attached, could be defined the partner to use,
this because the partner will not found. To this, is necessary set access to ``Allow to force to use
a specific partner in the invoice generation``.

Configure fuel SAT codes
-------------------------

In this section it can configure new SAT codes for fuels, which have been published by the SAT in its product catalog.

The fuel range codes 15101500 to 15101515 are already registered, so it is not necessary to add them.
